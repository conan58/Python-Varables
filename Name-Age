# A program that prompts the user for their name and age, and then prints a message using the user's input:
#
# Declare variable and prompt the user for their name and age.
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

# Print a message using the user's  input
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

#Notice the "f" function there.  You must do that to make this work.  That function allows you to do a one line like above.

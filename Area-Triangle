# A program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height:
#
# Prompt the user for the base and height of the triangle
base = float(input("Enter the Base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
#
# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height
#
# Print the result
print(f"The area of the triangle is {area}.")

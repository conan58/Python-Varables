# A program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius:
#
import math

# Prompt the user for the radius of the circle
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
#
# Calculate the area of the circle
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
#
# Print the result
print(f"The area of the circle is {area:.2f}.")
